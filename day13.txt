1. What are the methods and modes used in files?
2. What is Higher Order Function?
3. What is Lambda Function? When we use Lambda Func? And we call Anonymous Function?
4. What is map? And its Parameters? When we use it?
5. What is filter? And its Parameters? When we use it?

1. Files:- we put all the text or any other data in files to read and write it.
           When building a website we use Download option, the downloaded Text/pdf would be in file format. we use file in that situation
   Methods and modes :- open(), close(), .write(), .read(), .readlines(), "w", "r", "a".  
   => For creating a file == open()
   => After write close the file
   => Before read or write we should open the file
   => readlines prints all lines in line. //["", "", ""]
   Format :- variable = open("filename","w") => we cannot read "r" if file is empty it gives error.

   Ex:- .write(""), .read()
     file = open("new.txt", "w")
     file.write("Hello World")
     file.write("Programming world in telugu\n we are learning python");
     file.close()
     file = open("new.txt", "r")
     print(file.read())
     print(file.read(5))

   Output:-
        Hello WorldProgramming world in telugu
        we are learning python
        Hello

   Ex:- append "a", .readlines(), 
     file = open("new.txt", "a")
     file.write(" 30 days challenge")
     file.close()
     file = open("new.txt", "r")
     print(file.read())

     file = open("new.txt", "r")
     print(file.readlines())

     file = open("new.txt", "r")
     print(file.readlines(1))

   output:- Hello WorldProgramming world in telugu
         we are learning python 30 days challenge 30 days challenge 30 days challenge 30 days challenge 30 days challenge
        ['Hello WorldProgramming world in telugu\n', ' we are learning python 30 days challenge 30 days challenge 30 days challenge 30 days challenge 30 days challenge']
        ['Hello WorldProgramming world in telugu\n']

2. Higher Order Function:-
   The function where we pass another function as parameter is Higher Order Function.
   => If we use return we can use the function value.

=> Return :- if we use return we can pass return value as input to other function.
=> Print :- if we prints it doesn't return 

**=> Lambda :- lambda is used for higher order function. lambda func are called Anonymous function, because no need to specify any data types (or) variable
subtration = lambda a,b : a-b
print(subtration(5, 2))
